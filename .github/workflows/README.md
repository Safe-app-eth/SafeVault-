# 🔐 Gnosis-vault

Welcome to your custom Safe{Wallet} Dashboard, designed

Perfect — since you're on an **iPhone**, let me tailor everything for **mobile-first setup and deployment**, with minimal terminal or desktop dependency.

We’ll make this **touch-friendly**, and you can either:
- Use **GitHub (web)** to create files + push changes,
- Or use **apps like [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807)** or **Play.js**, which let you run GitHub + code from iOS.

## 📱 Mobile-Friendly Plan for Setting Up `Gnosis-vault🔐`

You don’t need to run CLI commands. Just follow these steps using Safari/Chrome or GitHub mobile app.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and:

- Create a new repo (e.g. `gnosis-vault`)
- Make it **private** or **public**, your choice
- No need to initialize with README (we’ll add that manually)

---

### 📁 Step 2: Manually Add These Folders & Files via GitHub Web

#### Required folders:.github/workflows/
src/pages/
src/utils/
scripts/
public/icons
---

### ✅ Now Create the Files One by One (Copy-Paste from Here):

#### 🔹 `README.md`

Go to your GitHub repo → `Add file` → `Create new file` → name it `README.md`

Paste this:

```md
