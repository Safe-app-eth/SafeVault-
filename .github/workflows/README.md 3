# 🏷 Label-Based Safe Proposal Trigger

## 🚀 What it does:
When a pull request is labeled `safe-proposal`, this action:

1. Triggers a Safe transaction proposal automatically.
2. Uses Reown to submit the tx to your Safe.
3. Logs output to GitHub Actions.

## 📥 Default Behavior:
Proposes:
- 0.1 ETH
- To `0x742d...` (update this in the script)
- With description: `Auto-proposed via label on PR #`

## 🔐 Secrets Required:
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SAFE_ADDRESS` | Your Safe address |
| `SAFE_RPC_URL` | Mainnet/Arbitrum RPC URL |
| `REOWN_API_KEY` | From Reown |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Actions default |

## 🧪 Usage:
1. Push a PR.
2. Label it with `safe-proposal`.
3. Action runs and proposes the tx!

✅ You can customize the amount, recipient, and logic later.
