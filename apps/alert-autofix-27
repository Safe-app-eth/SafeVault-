#  🛡️ Security Fix PR: Resolve GitHub Actions Permissions Alert (#27)

**Branch:** `alert-autofix-27`  
**Commit:** Autofix for GitHub Actions permission scope

---

### 🔧 What Changed

This pull request introduces a security-focused patch addressing the following issue:

- **Alert #27** – “Workflow does not contain permissions”  
- ✅ Added explicit `permissions:` block to GitHub Actions workflows  
- ✅ Scoped to least-privilege model (read-only where possible)  
- ✅ Auto-generated and committed with GitHub Copilot Autofix

### 📄 Commit Message

> **Potential fix for code scanning alert no. 27:**  
> Workflow does not contain permissions  
> _Co-authored by GitHub Copilot Autofix_

### 🔐 Why This Matters

GitHub Actions now runs workflows with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` scoped to **default read/write access** unless overridden. This change mitigates risk by:

- Preventing escalation of token privileges
- Ensuring workflows only perform explicitly intended operations

---

### 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Actions still pass for PRs and main deployments  
- ✅ Code scanning confirms no alert on modified workflows  
- ✅ Vercel deploy preview still triggers correctly
