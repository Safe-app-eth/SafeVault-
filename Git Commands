- \`public/manifest.json\` with SafeVault branding
- \`public/service-worker.js\` for basic offline caching
- Optimized icons (\`icon-192.png\`, \`icon-512.png\`)
- \`pages/index.tsx\` with live deployment message
- Vercel-ready structure

Next.js users should ensure \`next-pwa\` is installed and \`next.config.js\` is updated to support service workers.

This sets the stage for a signer-ready, mobile-friendly Safe dashboard experience."
