## üîê Security Overview ‚Äì SafeVault üîê

SafeVault is a custom Safe{Wallet} frontend built on **Next.js**, hosted on **Vercel**, and powered by the [Reown AppKit](https://appkit-lab.reown.org). This project enforces strong Web3 security practices to ensure wallet interactions and transaction data remain secure, private, and tamper-resistant.

### ‚úÖ HTTP Security Headers

| Header | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` | Prevents sensitive content from being cached in the browser or by intermediaries. |
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Enforces a strict whitelist of trusted domains for scripts, styles, images, frames, fonts, and connections. |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | Forces use of HTTPS with a two-year (63072000 seconds) HSTS policy. |
| `frame-ancestors` | Limits embedding to trusted domains such as `https://app.safe.global`. |
| `report-uri`, `Report-To` | All CSP violations are reported to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) for real-time auditing. |
| `X-Vercel-Cache` | Ensures dynamic data (like wallet info) is **not** served from cache when inappropriate. |

### üîó Trusted Third-Party Integrations

SafeVault only connects to a controlled set of trusted, audited services:

- **WalletConnect** (`walletconnect.com`, `walletconnect.org`) ‚Äì for session, RPC, and relay
- **Token metadata** ‚Äì `tokens.1inch.io`, `ipfs.io`, `cdn.zerion.io`
- **Safe AppKit / Reown** ‚Äì `appkit-lab.reown.org`, `secure.reown.com`
- **Public RPCs** ‚Äì via PublicNode (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Gnosis, Optimism, Base)
- **Other APIs** ‚Äì `quote-api.jup.ag`, `mempool.space`, etc. (for advanced swap and mempool tools)

These are explicitly defined in the `Content-Security-Policy` header and cannot be overridden at runtime.

### üì° Real-Time Monitoring

- **Sentry Integration:** All security policy violations are automatically reported to Sentry.
- **Inline Script Protection:** Scripts are only executed if they match the defined nonce value and come from trusted sources.
- **Dynamic pages only:** Caching is disabled for all pages involving wallet data or transaction review.

---

### üßæ Notes

- This project is intended for use as an embedded dApp inside Safe{Wallet}, or as a standalone progressive web interface.
- The frontend is **stateless by design**, with **no storage of private keys, session data, or PII**.
- You can deploy it via Vercel, GitHub Pages, or other static hosts, with security and performance optimized by default.
